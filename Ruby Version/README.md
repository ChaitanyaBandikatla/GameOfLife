# GameOfLife in Ruby
This folder contains working code for Conway's game of life in Ruby language.

There are two options to run this code on your system. I would prefer the first one as it is more easier to do.

1) Run the code on a online ruby compiler : https://repl.it/languages/ruby

   The online compiler provides options to upload the file where you can upload the file gameOfLife.rb and run it online. You could also alternativly copy the code and paste it into the online editor.

2) You could install Ruby Mine which is an IDE for Ruby Projects, This link has the information on how to install Ruby Mine : https://www.jetbrains.com/help/ruby/get-started.html#interpreter
   
    Once ruby mine is setup, you could run the ruby file on it.

If you prefer other options to go with building and setting up the ruby environment you are free to do so.

Happy Coding
