# GameOfLife in Rust
This folder contains working code for Conway's game of life in Rust language.

To build and run the game of life on your machine, follow the below steps:

 - Firstly, you need to install rust from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will also install [cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo), so it is not required to install it separately.
 - After that, you can build the code using `cargo build`.
 - Then, the code can be run using `cargo run`.
 - You should be able to enter your desired inputs for the number of rows, number of columns, number of live cells to start with, and number of steps/iterations.
 - The code would print the board after every iteration!
