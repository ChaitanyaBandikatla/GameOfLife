# GameOfLife
Repository for GameOfLife in three different programming languages

### Proposed way of going about the software evaluation human trials

- A Google form for signing up for software evaluation trials with their preferred time slots is put up.
- We get the information on their expertise in three coding languages used in the evaluations from the forms.
- Using the preferred time slots, we schedule video calls ( preferably via zoom ) for 30 mins.
- The user is expected to try to debug in all the three languages within the timeframe.
- Although that is the expectation, the user is free to do what they want to.
- The user is expected to turn on the video and also share his screen during the entire session.
- We just take an observation role and document the process of the person debugging the code.
- We take in all this data and will compile them.
- We draw inferences from the compilation after eliminating errors in observation.

**Note:** *All personal and identifying information will be anonymized and not made public.*

This is the tentative way of how we plan to perform the software evaluation process.
